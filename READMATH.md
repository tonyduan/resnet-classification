### CNN Image Classification 

Last update: May 2020

---

Starter code for (robust) image classification with deep residual networks.

Contains implementations of the following models, for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet:

- ResNet [1]
- ResNet V2, often called "pre-activation" [2]
- Wide ResNet [3]
- Squeeze and Excitation ResNet [4]

**Robustness**

We are interested in a *robust* model, which is to say: although we train on a distribution $P$, we still want good performance for a worst-case distribution $Q$ within some uncertainty set. Implicitly this relies on a definition of distance between distributions. Below we consider two examples.

For $\ell_p$ adversarial robustness, we implement empirical attacks:

- PGD for L-2 and L-inf robustness [5]
- FGSM for L-inf robustness [6]

For semantic robustness, the state-of-the-art defense is advanced data augmentation techniques such as such as AugMix or Expectation over Transformation. This is still todo.

**Calibration**

Beyond discrimination, we are interested in the *calibration* of a model. It turns out that deep classifiers are not calibrated by default, despite log-likelihood being a proper scoring rule [7]. This is a result of over-fitting to the training data [8]. Mixup [9] is implemented because it's been shown to improve calibration by regularizing the model [10]. We evaluate with the de-biased $\ell_2$ calibration metric over a pre-specified number of bins, following [11]. 

We remark that *adversarial training* without mixup makes it easier to yield well-calibrated models because it takes longer (more iterations) to overfit to the training data. Yet adversarial training does eventually overfit [12], so calibration eventually suffers unless further regularization is applied.
